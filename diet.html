            Ferrets are obligate carnivores. They have fast metabolisms and short digestive tracts so they must eat frequently. In the wild, they eat whole small animals, including meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers, and fur. Prepared dried foods for domesticated ferrets consist of almost entirely meat, but some owners prefer to feed their ferrets live or pre-killed prey (e.g. mice and rabbits). Ferrets are unable to digest plants and they imprint on their food at an early age, making feeding a new food to an older ferret harder.
